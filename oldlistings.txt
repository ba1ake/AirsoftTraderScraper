It comes with three mags, two of which are standard and the other is an extended mag which is brand new. They all have been very well maintained too. I have kept all the seals lubed and stored with green gas inside the mags before storing away.I have never had a single issue with this gun and I always get complements on it when I bring it out for use, it’s A LOT of fun to shoot.There are a couple very minor scratches on it, but other than that it is in very good condition.Purchasing this gun will come with the gun itself, the gun case, three mags and a brand new fully sealed 1kg bag of 0.25g  SRC BB’s.Pick up is preferred, but will ship at the buyers expense.Happy to answer any questions you have.']
